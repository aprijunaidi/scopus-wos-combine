# Combining Scopus and Web of Science Databases using R Studio

Welcome to this project! In this repository, we aim to combine two of the most comprehensive academic databases - **Scopus** and **Web of Science (WoS)** - using **R Studio**. 

## Why Combine Scopus and WoS?

Both Scopus and WoS are rich sources of bibliometric data, each with their own strengths. Scopus, with its extensive journal coverage and citation data, and WoS, known for its robust citation indexing, provide complementary insights. By combining these databases, we can leverage the strengths of both, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust dataset for our research.

## How Do We Use R Studio?

R Studio is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. It provides a wide range of libraries and functions that make it easier to manipulate, analyze, and visualize complex datasets. In this project, we will use R Studio to clean, merge, and analyze data from Scopus and WoS.

## What's in this Repository?

In this repository, you will find R scripts for downloading, cleaning, and merging data from Scopus and WoS. Additionally, there will be scripts for some preliminary analyses of the combined dataset. 

We hope this project will serve as a valuable resource for researchers looking to harness the power of bibliometric data from Scopus and WoS. We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve the project.

Let's dive into the world of bibliometric analysis with R Studio!
